/***************************************************************************//**
 * A brief history of Doxygen-style banner comments.
 *
 * This is a Doxygen-style C-style "banner" comment. It starts with a "normal"
 * comment and is then converted to a "special" comment block near the end of
 * the first line. It is written this way to be more "visible" to developers
 * who are reading the source code.
 * This style of commenting behaves poorly with clang-format.
 *
 * @param theory Even if there is only one possible unified theory. it is just a
 *               set of rules and equations.
