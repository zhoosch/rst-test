   * A brief history of Doxygen-style banner comments.
   *
   * This is a Doxygen-style C-style "banner" comment. It starts with a "normal"
   * comment and is then converted to a "special" comment block near the end of
   * the first line. It is written this way to be more "visible" to developers
   * who are reading the source code.
   * This style of commenting behaves poorly with clang-format.
   *
   * @param theory Even if there is only one possible unified theory. it is just a
   *               set of rules and equations.
